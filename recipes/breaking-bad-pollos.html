    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Chicken Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Into a small bowl, combine 15 grams of cayenne pepper, 10 grams each of aleppo pepper and ground coriander, <br>
                    and 15 grams of red pepper flakes that have been ground in a spice grinder. Whisk to combine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Set aside 3 tablespoons for the curly fries. Turn the rest into a dry brine for the chicken by adding 15 grams 
                    of kosher salt. <br> Whisk to combine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using 1 whole chicken, cut into the classic 10 piece fried chicken pieces.</p></li>
                <li><p>Load the pieces onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and generously sprinkle on all sides with the 
                    dry-brine mixture. <br> Place in the fridge uncovered for 4-24 hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>For the batter, in a medium bowl combine 100 grams each of all-purpose flour and cornstarch, an optional sprinkle 
                    of the <br> spice mixture, 250 grams of water, 30 grams of vodka, and 2 large eggs. Whisk together until a pancake 
                    batter consistency <br> is reached. Cover and refrigerate for a couple of hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using the batter, along with a pie pan of flour, dunk each piece of chicken into the flour followed by the batter 
                    making sure <br> each piece is thoroughly coated. Rinse and repeat for all chicken pieces.</p></li>
                <li><p>In a 375째F pot of frying oil, carefully place the chicken pieces into the oil (facing away from you, no splashes!) 
                    and frying <br> 7-10 minutes depending on the size of the piece. Turn every other minute or so to make sure no scorching 
                    is developing. <br> Once golden brown and 175-185째F for dark meat, 165째F for white meat, remove.</p></li>
                <li><p>Drain and cool on a paper towel-lined baking sheet before serving.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Curly Fries Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Using a spiralizer, lock in 1 russet potato, and over a bowl of boiling water begin spiralizing the potato. 
                    Rinse and repeat with <br> remaining potatoes. Make sure all the potato twists are underwater.</p></li>
                <li><p>Let sit for 15 minutes then drain.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once drained, dump the potatoes onto a paper towel-lined baking tray and sandwich between paper towels and pat until as dry as possible.</p></li>
                <li><p>After the potatoes are fully dry, grab some scissors and cut the potatoes into shorter pieces. Not too long, but not too 
                    short due <br> to curling up in the frying oil.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once the potatoes have been snipped, place back onto the baking sheet covering with a paper towel while the batter is made.</p></li>
                <li><p>Into a large bowl, combine 15 grams of paprika, 60 grams of all-purpose flour, 15 grams of cayenne pepper, 6 grams of onion powder, <br> 
                    and a tiny pinch of kosher salt. Add in the reserved spice blend and whisk to combine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add in 150 grams of water (or however much is required) and whisk together until a little lighter than the consistency of paint.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once the right consistency is reached, dump in the potatoes and give them a toss until thoroughly coated and battered.</p></li>
                <li><p>In a cast-iron skillet filled with 1 quart of peanut oil heated to 350째F, carefully and gently lower the fries into the oil 
                    in batches <br> and spread out evenly and fry for 2-5 minutes until a deep reddish-brown.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet and generously season with kosher salt while still warm.</p></li>
            </ol>
