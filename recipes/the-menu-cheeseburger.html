    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>American Cheese Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 200 °F. Line a half sheet tray with a non-stick silicone mat.</p></li>
                <li><p>Combine the cheese(s) in the bowl and set aside.</p></li>
                <li><p>Combine the milk and sodium citrate in a large sauce pot. Place the prepared sheet tray in the oven, then bring to 
                    a simmer <br> while stirring constantly over medium heat.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the shredded cheese to the pot. Stir to submerge the cheese, then combine the mixture using a hand immersion blender.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour the cheese mixture into the heated sheet tray, tilt/spread the cheese mixture into an even layer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cover the sheet tray in plastic wrap, then refrigerate until solidified, about 1-2 hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Unmold the cheese from the tray and slice into squares. Reserve in the refrigerator until ready to use.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Potato Buns Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Combine the bread flour, potato flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk to combine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the water, milk, and eggs to the bowl and using the dough hook attachment, begin mixing the dough on medium-low speed.</p></li>
                <li><p>With the mixer still running, add the butter, one piece at a time, to the dough.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once all of the butter is incorporated, increase the mixing speed to medium high and mix for 8-10 minutes or until the dough 
                    is <br> smooth and no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl.</p></li>
                <li><p>Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Proof the dough at room temperature or in the proofer 
                    for <br> 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</p></li>
                <li><p>Divide the dough into 6 even pieces, then shape the portions into taugh rounds. Place the dough rounds on a parchment-line sheet tray.</p></li>
                <li><p>Loosely cover the dough rounds in plastic wrap. Proof the buns for 1 - 2 hours or until puffed and the dough no longer springs 
                    back <br> entirely when poked.</p></li>
                <li><p>Towards the end of the proofing period, preheat the oven to 350 °F.</p></li>
                <li><p>Brush the proofed buns with Egg Wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bake the buns for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown and the internal temperature has reached 195 °F - 200 °F.</p></li>
                <li><p>Allow the buns to cool completely before slicing in half.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Egg Wash Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk to combine and set aside until ready to use.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Crinkle-Cut Fries Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Fill a large pot ⅔ of the way full with water.</p></li>
                <li><p>Peel and cut the potatoes into ½ inch x 3-4 inch wedges using a crinkler cutter. Then transfer the cut fries to the pot with water.</p></li>
                <li><p>Season the water with 1 tablespoon of salt and vinegar.</p></li>
                <li><p>Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then continue simmering the fries until almost falling apart, 20-22 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Using a spider, carefully transfer the fries to a cooling rack placed in a sheet tray.</p></li>
                <li><p>Let the fries cool to room temperature then freeze overnight.</p></li>
                <li><p>The next day, preheat 2-3 inches of oil in a large high-walled skillet to 275 °F.</p></li>
                <li><p>Working in batches, add the fries to the oil and fry until just beginning to gain color, about 5-7 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Return the fries to the same cooling rack and sheet tray. Freeze the fries for at least 2 hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Towards the end of the freezing period, preheat the same oil to 375 °F.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the frozen fries to the oil and fry until golden brown and extremely crisp, about 4-6 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Transfer the triple cooked fries to a paper towel-lined sheet tray and season generously the salt. Serve warm.</p></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Cheeseburger Method:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Place all of the meat grinder pieces in the freezer. Allow the equipment to freeze for 1 hour before use.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cut the various beef cut into 1 inch cubes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Line a sheet tray with parchment paper and add the cubed meat. Freeze for 20-30 minutes, or until very firm, but not frozen solid.</p></li>
                <li><p>Grind the par-frozen meat using the medium grind setting/plate. Combine the ground meat in a large bowl.</p></li>
                <li><p>Form the ground meat mixture into 6 ounce balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat a large flattop or cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Add 1-2 teaspoons of oil, then place the Potato Buns cut-side down <br> onto the pan. 
                    Toast the buns for 1-2 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer the buns to a plate.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add another 1-2 teaspoons of oil to the pan. Place two 6-ounce beef balls onto the pan about 3 inches apart from each other. <br> Using a heavy duty 
                    metal spatula, depress the beef balls until about ½ inch larger than the size of the potato buns.</p></li>
                <li><p>Season the cooking burgers with salt and pepper, then add a few slices of onion to each patty. Continue cooking the burgers for 2-3 minutes <br> or 
                    until well browned on one side, then flip the burgers and top each with 2 slices of American Cheese.</p></li>
                <li><p>Continue cooking the patties until well browned on the other side and the cheese has melted, about 2-4 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place one burger ontop of the other and transfer the double stacked burger to the halved potato bun.</p></li>
                <li><p>Serve immediately with crinkle cut fries.</p></li>
                <li><p>Repeat the cooking process with the remaining beef patties, cheese, buns, and fries.</p></li>
            </ol>
