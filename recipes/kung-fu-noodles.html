        <h3>Hand-Pulled Noodles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>500 g bread flour</li>
                <li>306 g water</li>
                <li>4 g store-bought potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate mix</li>
                <li>5 g salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Homemade Chili Oil:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Szechuan peppercorns</li>
                <li>Star anise pods</li>
                <li>Cassia bark</li>
                <li>Knob of peeled ginger</li>
                <li>3 lightly crushed cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>Canola oil (or any neutral flavored oil)</li>
                <li>Sichuan chili</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Broth:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Put pork bone, short rib, and pig's tail into a tall, narrow stock pot, then cover with cold water. 
                    Put pot on the stove and bring it to a simmer to pull <br> impurities out of the meat. Skim the gray foamy 
                    layer of impurities off the top of the water, drain the water out, and scrub the bones and meat clean.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place clean bones and meat into the empty clean stockpot, adding your choice of aromatics. I used a 
                    little handfulof licorice root, <br> a healthy-sized chunk of cassia bark (aka Chinese cinnamon or just cinnamon), 
                    a few pieces of dried tangerine peel, a handful of dried <br> longan fruit, a handful of dried star anise pods, 
                    a whole onion quartered, a handful of fresh ginger freshly peeled, and two carrots. <br> I also threw in 4 dried Chinese 
                    scallops, which are expensive but are a huge umami booster.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cover with cold water and put it on the stove, bringing the pot to a bare simmer. At the beginning of the boil, 
                    skim off any scum.</p></li>
                <li><p>Keep it on the stove slow and low for 4-12 hours, just barely bubbling so the broth stays clear. Once flavors and colors 
                    are nice and deep, <br> strain cool in an ice bath and refrigerate overnight.</p></li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Hand-Pulled Noodles:</h3>
        <h4>(not for the faint of heart!)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Combine the four elements of hand-pulled noodles: 500g of bread flour, 306g of water, 5g of salt, and 4g of a mix of 
                    potassium carbonate <br> and sodium bicarbonate (Note: there are countless ratios that can vary based on a number of factors 
                    such as altitude.). Mix ingredients until <br> just combined in a stand mixer. Knead for 40 minutes, ideally until dough 
                    resembles chewed gum but no need to keep going past 40 minutes <br> if it hasn't quite reached that consistency. Cover with 
                    plastic wrap and let rest for 15-20 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Gently tug the dough until it's elongated, fold it over on top of itself, and repeat. This process can take anywhere from 
                    20 minutes to 2 hours <br> until the dough resembles chewing gum texture. Pounding the dough against the table as you stretch also 
                    helps. Keep the dough hydrated by <br> patting it down and brushing with water every 4-6 tugs. It should be between a very hydrated 
                    bread dough and pasta dough. Alternatively, <br> laminate and flatten the dough until it becomes supple enough to pass through a pasta 
                    roller and spaghetti cutter.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cut the dough in half to make it easier to work with, keeping the other half covered with plastic. Stretch and give the dough a 
                    few slaps on the <br> tabletop to prevent tearing. Give it an even roll, then evenly dust with flour to prevent sticking. It should look 
                    like a rope. Fold, stretch, and repeat <br> until noodles form. Alternatively, stretch out each noodle one at a time, resulting in flatter 
                    and less uniform noodles. I recommend just putting <br> the dough through a pasta roller and spaghetti cutter if you are ever going to try 
                    to make these noodles at home.</p></li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Homemade Chili Oil:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>In a small saucepan, throw a handful of Szechuan peppercorns, star anise pods, cassia bark, a knob of peeled ginger, and 3 lightly 
                    crushed cloves of garlic.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour 2-3 cups of canola oil over the top and gently swirl over medium heat until the oil reaches about 325Â°F.</p></li>
                <li><p>Strain and pour over about a cup of Sichuan chili flakes into a heat-proof bowl. Give a little mix and set aside for about 30 minutes 
                    to cool.</p></li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>Noodle Soup:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>In a pot of water, cook noodles quickly and gently for no more than 90 seconds.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add peeled and sliced Daikon radish to the broth as it is being heated up. Let simmer for about 20 minutes until soft. Check the broth
                    for taste <br> and add seasoning as necessary.</p></li>
                <li><p>Scoop out the noodles with a sieve, dump into an empty bowl, and ladle broth over the top. Make sure there's a radish slice and add a 
                    handful of <br> Chinese chives or scallions with a dollop of chili oil on top. Enjoy!</p></li>
            </ol>
